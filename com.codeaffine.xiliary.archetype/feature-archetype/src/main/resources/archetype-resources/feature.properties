         plug-in fragments ("Fragments"), and features ("Features").${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
       - Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java(TM) ARchive)${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
         in a directory named "plugins".${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
       - A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}

       - Feature directories${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
Provisioning Technology (as defined below), you must agree to a license ("Feature ${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
Update License") during the installation process. If the Feature contains${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
the "license" property of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}

${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}Use of Provisioning Technology${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
The Eclipse Foundation makes available provisioning software, examples of which include,${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
but are not limited to, p2 and the Eclipse Update Manager ("Provisioning Technology") for${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
the purpose of allowing users to install software, documentation, information and/or${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
other materials (collectively "Installable Software"). This capability is provided with${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
the intent of allowing such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
Information about packaging Installable Software is available at${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html ("Specification").${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install Installable Software.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
You shall be responsible for enabling the applicable license agreements relating to the${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
Installable Software to be presented to, and accepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
in accordance with the Specification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
making it available in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
agreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the following:${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
       1. A series of actions may occur ("Provisioning Process") in which a user may execute${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          the Provisioning Technology on a machine ("Target Machine") with the intent of installing,${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          extending or updating the functionality of an Eclipse-based product.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
       2. During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third party${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          Installable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to the Target Machine.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
       3. Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and conditions that${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          govern the use of the Installable Software ("Installable Software Agreement") and such${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          Installable Software Agreement shall be accessed from the Target Machine in accordance${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          with the Specification. Such Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          terms and conditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance by${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable Software Agreement. Upon such${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          indication of agreement by the user, the provisioning Technology will complete installation${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
          of the Installable Software.${symbol_escape}n${symbol_escape}
